In a prediction problem, a model is usually given a dataset of known data on which training is run (training dataset), and a dataset of unknown data (or first seen data) against which the model is tested (called the validation dataset or testing set). The goal of cross-validation is to test the model's ability to predict new data that was not used in estimating it, in order to flag problems like overfitting or selection bias and to give an insight on how the model will generalize to an independent dataset (i.e., an unknown dataset, for instance from a real problem)."],"metadata":{"id":"MLzAi9t7Kbb3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["X = df_concrete.copy()\n","y = X.pop(\"Concrete compressive strength\")"],"metadata":{"id":"utUE6E8Vovew","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647550082163,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":260,"user":{"displayName":"Xibelly Eliseth MOSQUERA ESCOBAR","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"11600827666978491903"}}},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["X.columns"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nknmfrGkozOp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647550369539,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":249,"user":{"displayName":"Xibelly Eliseth MOSQUERA ESCOBAR","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"11600827666978491903"}},"outputId":"0986a43e-23f9-4adb-b689-c6c1c19da558"},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Index(['Cement', 'Blast Furnace Slag', 'Fly Ash', 'Water ',\n","       'Superplasticizer ', 'CoarseAggregate  ', 'FineAggregate ', 'Age'],\n","      dtype='object')"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":32}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create synthetic features\n","X[\"FCRatio\"] = X['FineAggregate '] / X['CoarseAggregate  ']\n","X[\"AggCmtRatio\"] = (X['CoarseAggregate  '] + X['FineAggregate ']) / X[\"Cement\"]\n","X[\"WtrCmtRatio\"] = X['Water '] / X[\"Cement\"]"],"metadata":{"id":"3V0YChdwoY6q","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647550425328,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":323,"user":{"displayName":"Xibelly Eliseth MOSQUERA ESCOBAR","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"11600827666978491903"}}},"execution_count":33,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Train and score baseline model\n","baseline = RandomForestRegressor(criterion=\"mae\", random_state=0)\n","baseline_score = cross_val_score(\n","    baseline, X, y, cv=5, scoring=\"neg_mean_absolute_error\"\n",")\n","baseline_score = -1 * baseline_score.mean()\n","\n","\n","\n","print(f\"MAE Score: {baseline_score:.4}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"vGfgWmyJKasP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647550452874,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":15746,"user":{"displayName":"Xibelly Eliseth MOSQUERA ESCOBAR","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"11600827666978491903"}},"outputId":"b1fed452-49b4-485a-a586-d7420d3181fb"},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/sklearn/ensemble/_forest.py:407: FutureWarning: Criterion 'mae' was deprecated in v1.0 and will be removed in version 1.2.
